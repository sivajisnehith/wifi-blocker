# wifi-blocker
This is a tool built on kali linux and etter cap.

This project demonstrates a network-level technique to selectively block internet access for a specific device within a local area network (LAN).
The tool is designed for educational and laboratory use only, focusing on understanding how ARP spoofing, packet forwarding, and firewall rules interact at Layer 2 and Layer 3 of the network stack
The script automates:

#Network interface discovery
#Host discovery within a subnet
#Target validation
#ARP-based traffic interception
#Internet blocking using firewall rules
#Safe network restoration
